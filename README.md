# GeneticAlgorithm
Copyright 2019 by Marco Costa

You are free to use my code however you want. Have at!

This project is composed of three classes:

1. GeneticAlgorithm. This class provides all the base functionality of the Genetic Algorithm and is meant to be extended by child classes. These child classes use GeneticAlgorithm's main functions to some practical end.
2. StringGA. Extends GeneticAlgorithm class. This class evolves randomly created strings to a "perfect" user generated string. (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
3. MusicGA. This class evolves randomly generated melodies to classical Baroque sensibilities. (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
